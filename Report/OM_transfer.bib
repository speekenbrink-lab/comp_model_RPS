abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

abstract = {Context plays a pivotal role in many decision-making scenarios, including social interactions wherein the identities and strategies of other decision makers often shape our behaviors. However, the neural mechanisms for tracking such contextual information are poorly understood. Here, we investigated how opponent identity affects human reinforcement learning during a simulated competitive game against two independent computerized opponents. We found that strategies of participants were affected preferentially by the outcomes of the previous interactions with the same opponent. In addition, reinforcement signals from the previous trial were less discriminable throughout the brain after the opponent changed, compared with when the same opponent was repeated. These opponent-selective reinforcement signals were particularly robust in right rostral anterior cingulate and right lingual regions, where opponent-selective reinforcement signals correlated with a behavioral measure of opponent-selective reinforcement learning. Therefore, when choices involve multiple contextual frames, such as different opponents in a game, decision making and its neural correlates are influenced by multithreaded histories of reinforcement. Overall, our findings are consistent with the availability of temporally overlapping, contextspecific reinforcement signals.},

@article{Rick2010,
abstract = {Psychologists have long recognized two kinds of learning: one that is relatively shallow and domain-specific; and another that is deeper, producing generalizable insights that transfer across domains. The game theory literature has only recently considered this distinction, and the conditions that stimulate the latter kind of "meaningful" learning in games are still unclear. Three experiments demonstrate that one kind of meaningful learning - acquisition of iterated dominance - occurs in the absence of any feedback. We demonstrate that such feedback-free meaningful learning transfers to new strategically similar games, and that such transfer does not typically occur when initial games are played with feedback. The effects of withholding feedback are similar to, and substitutable with, those produced by requiring players to explain their behavior, a method commonly employed in psychology to increase deliberation. This similarity suggests that withholding feedback encourages deeper thinking about the game in a manner similar to such self-explanation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We studied transfer of learning across two games of strategic interaction. We found that the interpersonal relation between two players during and across two games influence development of reciprocal trust and transfer of learning from one game to another. We show that two types of similarities between the games affect transfer: (1) deep similarities facilitate transfer of an optimal solution across games; (2) surface similarities can either facilitate or hinder transfer depending on whether they lead players toward an optimal or sub-optimal solution in the target game. Learning an optimal solution in a context of interdependence between players is associated with development of reciprocal trust, which in turn mediates transfer of learning across games. The results can be used to inform the design of training exercises to develop strategic interaction skills. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present a computational cognitive model that explains transfer of learning across two games of strategic interaction - Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken. We summarize prior research showing that, when these games are played in sequence, the experience acquired in the first game influences the players' behavior in the second game. The same model accounts for human data in both games. The model explains transfer effects with the aid of a trust mechanism that determines how rewards change depending on the dynamics of the interaction between players. We conclude that factors pertaining to the game or the individual are insufficient to explain the whole range of transfer effects and factors pertaining to the interaction between players should be considered as well.},

The methodology consists of (1) a generalized repeated-game strategy space, (2) a mapping between histories and repeated-game beliefs, and (3) asynchronous updating of repeated-game strategies. We implement the proposed methodology by building on three proven action-learning models. Their predictions with repeated-game strategies are then validated with data from experiments with human subjects in four, symmetric 2 × 2 games: Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, Stag-Hunt, and Chicken. The models with repeated-game strategies approximate subjects' behavior substantially better than their respective models with action learning. Additionally, inferred rules of behavior in the experimental data overlap with the predicted rules of behavior. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Rule learning posits that decision makers, rather than choosing over actions, choose over behavioral rules with different levels of sophistication. Rules are reinforced over time based on their historically observed payoffs in a given game. Past works on rule learning have shown that when playing a single game over a number of rounds, players can learn to form sophisticated beliefs about others. Here we are interested in learning that occurs between games where the set of actions is not directly comparable from one game to the next. We study a sequence of ten thrice-played dissimilar games. Using experimental data, we find that our rule learning model captures the ability of players to learn to reason across games. However, this learning appears different from within-game rule learning as previously documented. The main adjustment in sophistication occurs by switching from non-belief-based strategies to belief-based strategies. The sophistication of the beliefs themselves increases only slightly over time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@techreport{Camerer,
abstract = {Coordination games have multiple Nash equilibria (i.e., sets of strategies which are best responses to one another). In``In``weak-link" coordination games players choose a number 1-7. Their payoff is increasing in the minimum number (or weakest link) and decreasing in the difference between their number and the minimum. Choosing 7 is an``an``efficient" equilibrium because it gives everybody a higher payoff than any other coordinated choice. Higher-payoff equilibria are riskier, however, so the game expresses the tradeoff between group efficiency and personal risk present in many social and organizational settings. We tested whether choosing efficiently in a weak-link game increases cooperative play in a subsequent prisoner's dilemma (PD) game. This cross-game transfer resembles transfer of cooperative norms in small firms (which are more like coordination games than PDs) as firms grow larger and become like PDs. In two experiments, if a group of players share a history of playing the weak-link game efficiently, that efficiency precedent can transfer to a subsequent PD game, improving the level of cooperativeness. The effect of transfer is much larger in magnitude (increasing cooperation from 15-30{\%} to 71{\%}) than the effects of most variables in previous PD studies. However, the transfer effect depends on descriptive similarity of strategies in the two games, since it largely disappears when the strategies are numbered differently in the weak-link game and the PD.},
